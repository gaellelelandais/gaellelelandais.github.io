    abstract = "{The functions of eukaryotic chromosomes and their spatial architecture in the nucleus are reciprocally dependent. Hi-C experiments are routinely used to study chromosome 3D organization by probing chromatin interactions. Standard representation of the data has relied on contact maps that show the frequency of interactions between parts of the genome. In parallel, it has become easier to build 3D models of the entire genome based on the same Hi-C data, and thus benefit from the methodology and visualization tools developed for structural biology. 3D modeling of entire genomes leverages the understanding of their spatial organization. However, this opportunity for original and insightful modeling is underexploited. In this paper, we show how seeing the spatial organization of chromosomes can bring new perspectives to omics data integration. We assembled state-of-the-art tools into a workflow that goes from Hi-C raw data to fully annotated 3D models and we re-analysed public omics datasets available for three fungal species. Besides the well-described properties of the spatial organization of their chromosomes (Rabl conformation, hypercoiling and chromosome territories), our results highlighted (i) in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the backbones of the cohesin anchor regions, which were aligned all along the chromosomes, (ii) in Schizosaccharomyces pombe, the oscillations of the coiling of chromosome arms throughout the cell cycle and (iii) in Neurospora crassa, the massive relocalization of histone marks in mutants of heterochromatin regulators. 3D modeling of the chromosomes brings new opportunities for visual integration of omics data. This holistic perspective supports intuition and lays the foundation for building new concepts.}",

abstract="Nowadays, generating omics data is a common activity for laboratories in biology. Experimental protocols to prepare biological samples are well described, and technical platforms to generate omics data from these samples are available in most research institutes. Furthermore, manufacturers constantly propose technical improvements, simultaneously decreasing the cost of experiments and increasing the amount of omics data obtained in a single experiment. In this context, biologists are facing the challenge of dealing with large omics datasets, also called ``big data'' or ``data deluge.'' Working with omics data raises issues usually handled by computer scientists, and thus cooperation between biologists and computer scientists has become essential to efficiently study cellular mechanisms in their entirety, as omics data promise. In this chapter, we define omics data, explain how they are produced, and, finally, present some of their applications in fundamental and medical research.",

               through re-exploiting multiple {RNA-seq} data",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Publicly available RNA-seq datasets are often
               underused although being helpful to improve functional
               annotation of eukaryotic genomes. This is especially true for
               filamentous fungi genomes which structure differs from most well
               annotated yeast genomes. Podospora anserina is a filamentous
               fungal model, which genome has been sequenced and annotated in
               2008. Still, the current annotation lacks information about
               cis-regulatory elements, including promoters, transcription
               starting sites and terminators, which are instrumental to
               integrate epigenomic features into global gene regulation
               strategies. RESULTS: Here we took advantage of 37 RNA-seq
               experiments that were obtained in contrasted developmental and
               physiological conditions, to complete the functional annotation
               of P. anserina genome. Out of the 10,800 previously annotated
               genes, 5'UTR and 3'UTR were defined for 7554, among which, 3328
               showed differential transcriptional signal starts and/or
               transcriptional end sites. In addition, alternative splicing
               events were detected for 2350 genes, mostly due alternative
               3'splice sites and 1732 novel transcriptionally active regions
               (nTARs) in unannotated regions were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Our
               study provides a comprehensive genome-wide functional annotation
               of P. anserina genome, including chromatin features, cis-acting
               elements such as UTRs, alternative splicing events and
               transcription of non-coding regions. These new findings will
               likely improve our understanding of gene regulation strategies
               in compact genomes, such as those of filamentous fungi.
               Characterization of alternative transcripts and nTARs paves the
               way to the discovery of putative new genes, alternative peptides
               or regulatory non-coding RNAs.",
